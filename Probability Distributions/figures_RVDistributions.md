# Random Variable Distributions
### Uniform Distribution 
Produced with the Linear Congruential Method

### Conversion to Bernoulli Distribution

### Conversion to Poisson Distribution

### Poisson Distribution Application - All times [1,10]
P(SignalPresent | X=k) plotted for times [1,10]

### Poisson Distribution Application - Time = 1 second
